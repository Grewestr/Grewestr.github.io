        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Jordan Grewe, a dedicated individual with a passion for advancing technology and its applications. Every challenge I undertake is seen through to completion, and I am committed and dedicated in all my endeavors.</p>
        
        <p>I am graduating in December with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am actively seeking full-time opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge. Simultaneously, I will be pursuing my Master's degree online at Georgia Tech.</p>
        
        <p>My journey in the technological field has been both enlightening and challenging. I am a lifelong learner, I aim to stay up to date with emerging technologies, and a proven leader who understands and caters to the needs of my teams. I am continuously looking forward to furthering my technical education and applying my skills in practical, real-world scenarios.</p>
        
        <h3>Specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. Interested in Computer Vision, and Embedded Systems</h3>
        <p>I am an accomplished and driven computer science graduate, and a huge nerd for embedded systems, machine learning, and computer vision. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and continuously advancing my technical skills. With a strong academic background and hands-on experience in software engineering, I am passionate about real-time operating systems and the integration of Machine Learning in embedded platforms.</p>

        <p>As a Software Engineering Intern at Airborne Systems, I have demonstrated leadership and innovation by developing advanced visualization tools and synchronization applications that significantly enhance operational efficiency. My previous roles include being an AI Model Training Specialist at Remotasks and a UI/UX Test Recruiter at Betting Hero, where I honed my skills in AI model validation, prompt engineering, and quality assurance for online platforms.</p>
        
        <p>One of my featured projects, an NBA Statistical Display, showcases a blend of electrical engineering and computer science expertise, highlighting my ability to design and implement complex systems.</p>

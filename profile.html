        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Jordan Grewe, a dedicated individual with a passion for advancing technology and its applications. Every challenge I undertake is seen through to completion, and I am committed and dedicated in all my endeavors.</p>
        
        <p>I am graduating in December with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am actively seeking full-time opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge. Simultaneously, I will be pursuing my Master's degree online at Georgia Tech, specializing in areas that fuel my passion: machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems.</p>
        
        <p>My journey in the technological field has been both enlightening and challenging. I am a lifelong learner, always looking towards the next summit to conquer, and a proven leader who understands and caters to the needs of my teams. I am continuously looking forward to furthering my technical education and applying my skills in practical, real-world scenarios.</p>
        
        <h3>Specializing in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Embedded Systems</h3>
        <p>I am an accomplished and driven computer science graduate specializing in embedded systems, machine learning, and computer vision. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and continuously advancing my technical skills. With a strong academic background and hands-on experience in software engineering, I am passionate about real-time operating systems and the integration of AI in embedded platforms.</p>

        <p>As a Software Engineering Intern at Airborne Systems, I have demonstrated leadership and innovation by developing advanced visualization tools and synchronization applications that significantly enhance operational efficiency. My previous roles include being an AI Model Training Specialist at Remotasks and a UI/UX Test Recruiter at Betting Hero, where I honed my skills in AI model validation, prompt engineering, and quality assurance for online platforms.</p>

        <p>My technical proficiency spans a wide array of programming languages and tools, including C, C++, Java, Python, SolidWorks, and MATLAB. I have a proven track record of utilizing Git version control, Agile methodologies, and project management tools, which underscores my ability to integrate seamlessly into dynamic development environments.</p>

        <p>One of my featured projects, an NBA Statistical Display, showcases a blend of electrical engineering and computer science expertise, highlighting my ability to design and implement complex systems.</p>

        <p>As a lifelong learner committed to staying ahead of new technology, I actively contribute to community initiatives through volunteer work and leadership roles in Pi Kappa Alpha and the Boy Scouts of America. I am excited about the prospect of integrating my skills and knowledge in future projects and am particularly keen on opportunities that will allow me to explore and enhance my expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems. I look forward to contributing to your company with my unique blend of skills and dedication while pursuing my Master's degree at Georgia Tech.</p>

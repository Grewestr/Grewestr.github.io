		<h2>Featured Projects</h2>

		<h3><strong>Speaker Backpack</strong></h3>
		<p>Initiated at the age of 16, the Speaker Backpack was my first engineering project, where I repurposed speakers from my brother's Dodge Neon and integrated an 8" sub, powered by a 12V DC battery. The design incorporated an echo chamber to optimize sound output, applying basic audio engineering principles. While the 70lb backpack was not the most practical in terms of portability, it was a hit at football practices and basketball games, teaching me about audio engineering, amp wiring, circuitry, and fabrication using heavy machinery like the shop bot.</p>

		<h3><strong>Cylindrical LED Display with Sound Sensor</strong></h3>
		<p>Designed as a "totem" for music festivals, this project utilized ~1200 individually addressed RGB pixels attached to an 8-foot carbon fiber pole to create distinguishable pattern algorithms visible from a distance. Integrated with a sound sensor and Arduino, the display responded to bass frequencies, altering patterns during music "drops". My brother graciously assisted with the coding aspect, while I took the lead in the hardware development and overall design of the project. While it garnered interest for purchase, it was not pursued due to cost-effectiveness and market size. This project enhanced my knowledge in matrix manipulation, transformation, and data vectoring, and was a wonderful experience in collaborative work and leadership.</p>

		<h3><strong>Replacing the Exhaust Manifold on a 4.6L V8 Boat Engine</strong></h3>
		<p>My friend and I embarked on a journey to refurbish a 1995 Regal speed boat, purchased for around 2 thousand dollars. Upon discovering a crack in the exhaust manifold and subsequent rust inside, we disassembled the engine, installed a new part, and retuned the engine. Despite initial stalling issues due to our tuning, professional retuning made it fully operational. This project provided insights into engine mechanics, tuning, and failure analysis.</p>

		<h3><strong>Drone from Scratch Project</strong></h3>
		<p>This project, while daunting, involved building a drone from scratch, utilizing a frame, 4 servo motors, a GeauxRobot Arduino, wires, and a sensor to verify motor input. The drone was programmed to operate in 5-second bursts to prevent it from flying away, collecting data to validate the efficiency of my algorithm. The goal was to execute a returnable flight path without GPS or RF communication, which proved to be a significant challenge. After several mishaps, I concluded that real-time communication is crucial for successful navigation and plan to revisit this project with an RF receiver and controller in the future.</p>

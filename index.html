		<h2>Featured Projects</h2>
		<h3><strong>Live NBA Display</strong></h3>
	        <p>Under my leadership as the Team Leader and Product Owner, a team of 6 students developed the Live Sports Display project with a focus on delivering a real-time sports visualization experience. This project, built on a Django framework and developed in Visual Studio Code, is hosted on Heroku, a cloud-based application service. Utilizing tesseract-OCR for intelligent image analysis, our web application processes user-uploaded screenshots of fantasy basketball teams. This data is then conveyed through SSH to a Raspberry Pi, driving the 3 ws2812b LED panels. To manage this process efficiently, we employed Celery with Redis to handle asynchronous task execution, ensuring a responsive and scalable system. While the project's core functionality is operational, we continue to work and aim to have this finished by May 2024. We will enhance the user interface and construct a 3D printed case for the hardware components. Please contact me for a longer video or explanation as gihthub only supports files less than 25 MB. </p>

		<h3><strong>Speaker Backpack</strong></h3>
		<p>Initiated at the age of 16, the Speaker Backpack was my first engineering project, where I repurposed speakers from my brother's Dodge Neon and integrated an 8" sub, powered by a 12V DC battery. The design incorporated an echo chamber to optimize sound output, applying basic audio engineering principles. While the 70lb backpack was not the most practical in terms of portability, it was a hit at football practices and basketball games, teaching me about audio engineering, amp wiring, circuitry, and fabrication using heavy machinery like the shop bot.</p>

		<h3><strong>Cylindrical LED Display with Sound Sensor</strong></h3>
		<p>Designed as a "totem" for music festivals, this project utilized ~1200 individually addressed RGB pixels attached to an 8-foot carbon fiber pole to create distinguishable pattern algorithms visible from a distance. Integrated with a sound sensor and Arduino, the display responded to bass frequencies, altering patterns during music "drops". My brother graciously assisted with the coding aspect, while I took the lead in the hardware development and overall design of the project. While it garnered interest for purchase, it was not pursued due to cost-effectiveness and market size. This project enhanced my knowledge in matrix manipulation, transformation, and data vectoring, and was a wonderful experience in collaborative work and leadership.</p>

		<h3><strong>Replacing the Exhaust Manifold on a 4.6L V8 Boat Engine</strong></h3>
		<p>My friend and I embarked on a journey to refurbish a 1995 Regal speed boat, purchased for around 2 thousand dollars. Upon discovering a crack in the exhaust manifold and subsequent rust inside, we disassembled the engine, installed a new part, and retuned the engine. Despite initial stalling issues due to our tuning, professional retuning made it fully operational. This project provided insights into engine mechanics, tuning, and failure analysis.</p>
